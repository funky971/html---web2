<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I would like to share a bit about my journey along my spiritual path. 
  </p>
  <p>
   As I was operating my previous business which involved selling homebrewing supplies, I was witnessing that a few of my customers who are heavy drinkers were getting their body knocked around by consuming excessive amounts of alcohol. </p>
   <p>
   I wasn't happy to continue this path selling products that were harming people health. </p>
   <p>
   I have been studing various subjects (books & courses) for number of years to help me with my business inculding personal growth as well, before I gained this insight.</p>
   <p>
   My studying shifted towards the spiritual path allowing me to explore this subject more deeply and I realise this path is my calling, as I knew that I wanted help people over many years.</p>
   <p>
   I have studied energy medicine from a few well respected energy healers however travelling overseas wasn't a good option for me at the time and they didn't offer any online course until I came across Four Winds.</p>
   <p>
   Then I looked into Four Winds culture and found Four Winds is more complete, compared to other forms of energy medicine.</p>
   <p>
   I became one of their energy practioners and along my journey I have gained great results for my clients.
</p>

<p>
  Over the years I have felt that I have had strong connection, with everything around me inculing people's energy. 
  After the lockdown I sensed the negitive energy all around me when I was in the carpark of my local shopping complex.
</p>

<p>
  Energy medicine has been around for many thousand of years across the earth, spanning across many different cultures as well. Energy Medicine is growing bigger as people are seeking more natural paths of healing recently.
  
</p>
<p>
  There's many different forms of energy healing however my tradition comes from the Andes and the Amazon culture.
</p>
<p>
  I perform a number of things in my energy healing work such as Decoupling/Illumation/Extraction work/energy cord cutting/Soul Retrival/energy clearing in your office/house and more.
</p>
<p>I also offer Life Strategist service with different approach than other "Life Strategist" out there due to my understanding of energy work.
</p>
  <p>I am sure that you would have many questions to ask me about this type of healing work or my Life Strategist service, please let me know.</p>
  <p> First up I would like to offer a free 20 mins initial consultation to see if you are suitable for this type of healing work or my Life Strategist service.</p>
  <p>The house/office energy clearing is done in person while the energy healing can be done either in person or video call. My Lfe Strategist service is aviable in person or video call.</p>
