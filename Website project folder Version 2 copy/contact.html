          <h1>Lucille - Australia </h1>
          <p>Following a profound personal loss and subsequent grief that </p>
          <p>overwhelmed me, I underwent medical sugery that required a </p>
          <p>lenghty recoververy period. During this challenging time, I had</p>
          <p>a opportunity to recieve energy & vibration healings from Matty.</p>
          <p>These sessions have been immensely benefical to me, both emotionally</p>
          <p>& physically. Matty's extensive knowledge & meticulous approach to </p>
          <p>clearing & chakra re-balancing techniques have made a significant </p>
          <p>difference in my healing journey. Thanks to his exertise & care, I have</p>
          <p>experienced a remarkable improvement in my well-being. I am </p>
          <p>deeply grateful for Matty's support & highly recommend his services</p>

            <h1>Janine - USA </h1>
            <p>During a healing session, Matty was checking my energy field for </p>
            <p>crystalized or fluid energies. During the process he found a energy </p>
            <p>cord that was attached to my right shoulder blade. Matty knew what to</p>
            <p>do and cut the cord successfully. When he told me about it, I was suprised. I immediately rotated my right shoulder. The ache was</p>
            <p>gone !! The stretching and the massage didn't help at all prior to seeing Matty. This is when I told Matty about the ache, we had not</p>
            <p>discussed it prior to the session. The great thing is that the ache</p>
            <p> never retrurned. Looking back over when the ache started, I had</p>
            <p> a very negative experience with a co-worker.</p>
            <p>I am very grateful for Matty's expertise.</p>
